But it won't be easy, you will have to evade traps and enemies if you wish to get to the door and keep climbing.\r\n\r\n#Enemies\r\nDuring your adventure you will face bandits that are trying to prevent you from reaching the top of the building. ![Bandits will try to prevent you from progresing.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objetos15162/Climber/master/Proyecto/Climber%202.0/images/Enemy_right_side1.png)\r\nIf you want to, you can get rid of them, but you'll have to find a knife first.\r\n![Knives are useful... if you widh to kill someone.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objetos15162/Climber/master/Proyecto/Climber%202.0/images/supercuchillodelamuerte.png)\r\n\r\n#Blocks\r\nDuring your journey you'll realize that there is more than just your regular kind of stone blocks.
