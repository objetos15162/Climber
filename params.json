But it won't be easy, you will have to evade traps and enemies if you wish to get to the door and keep climbing.      \r\n![Menu de inicio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objetos15162/Climber/master/Inicio.jpg)\r\n\r\n#Enemies\r\nDuring your adventure you will face bandits that are trying to prevent you from reaching the top of the building. ![Bandits will try to prevent you from progresing.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objetos15162/Climber/master/Proyecto/Climber%202.0/images/Enemy_right_side1.png)    \r\nIf you want to, you can get rid of them, but you'll have to find a knife first.\r\n![Knives are useful... if you widh to kill someone.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objetos15162/Climber/master/Proyecto/Climber%202.0/images/supercuchillodelamuerte.png)      \r\n![This game is freacking great.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objetos15162/Climber/master/nivel3.jpg)\r\n\r\n#Blocks\r\nDuring your journey you'll realize that there is more than just your regular kind of stone blocks. Use your brain and lear to use some of them to your advantage.  \r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objetos15162/Climber/master/Proyecto/Climber%202.0/images/Bomb_0.png)  \r\nBomb blocks are tricky. They look just like regular blocks, until you touch them.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objetos15162/Climber/master/Proyecto/Climber%202.0/images/Spiked_block.png)  \r\nMany adventurers have tried to get to the top doors, their blood now rests in these blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objetos15162/Climber/master/Proyecto/Climber%202.0/images/block_ice_small.png)      \r\nThese ones are pretty obvious, they are slippery.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in the game´s class organization, here's the class diagram.  \r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objetos15162/Climber/master/Proyecto/Climber-Final-Diagram.PNG)",
